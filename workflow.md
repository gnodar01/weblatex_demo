Authenticate using GitHub (along with using Github's rather granular access control mechanisms):

---

Initialize the devcontainer, which has the extensions preinstalled for you (along with your own local extensions):

---

Author your latex documents, get auto-compiling, synced rendering, etc.:

---

Version control the document using git. It's just git, so automate/script it however you want. For example, watch for changes and auto-commit on save or auto-commit on re-render, or every 5 minutes, etc.
